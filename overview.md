The Power BI [deployment pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview) tools enables BI teams to build an efficient and reusable release process for their Power BI content. You can leverage the tasks in this Azure DevOps extension to integrate Power BI into your organization's automation process. Here are a few examples of what can be done using the APIs:
- Manage Power BI pipelines from start to finish, including creating a pipeline, assigning a workspace to any stage, deploying and deleting the pipeline.
- Assign users to a pipeline.
- Assign users to a workspace.
- Deploy all/selected items in a Power BI pipeline to the next stage.
